- Bryce Earls (MS student, Environmental Science Program) <bearls1@islander.tamucc.edu> <br /> Bryce received his B.S. in Environmental Science from TAMUCC and is now pursuing his M.S. in Environmental Science with a concentration in Coastal Systems. He has research experience working with coral skeletal growth, and he now works with the Lin Lab investigating the composition of manatee microbiomes. One of Bryce’s greatest passions is SCUBA diving, and he has spent over 500 hours diving at the Texas State Aquarium. When he’s not in the lab or underwater, Bryce enjoys hiking, keeping tarantulas, and spending time on the beach with his friends and his rescue dog, General.

- Anne Christabel Martin (Undergrad Summer Research Intern) <christabelm2000@gmail.com> <br /> Christabel is a neuroscience major at the University of Texas at Austin, pursuing the pre-med track. She is currently a summer research intern in our lab, working on cattle-associated microbiomes. With aspirations toward a career in cardiology or surgery, Christabel is eager to explore diverse research areas to understand how they can inform and enhance medical practice. Outside the lab, she enjoys rock climbing, exercising, and music.
