## Current lab members

- Mahima Yogesh (MS Student, Marine Biology Program) <myogesh@islander.tamucc.edu> <br /> Mahima received B.S. in Bioenvironmental Sciences and minor in Oceanography from Texas A&M University. Mahima is currently leading a coastal time-series study at Horace Caldwell Pier to investigate the dynamics of plankton and microbiome in relationship to environmental variables. Mahima loves to sing, cook, and spend time in the outdoors. She hopes to one day work at NGO that focuses on the intersections of climate policy, ocean conservation, and climate justice.
