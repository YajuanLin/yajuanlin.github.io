Mahima graduated from Texas A&M University at College Station in 2022, where she received her Bachelor of Science in Bioenvironmental Sciences and minor in Oceanography. During her four years, she found her love for pursuing research through working in an oceanography lab as well as a fungal microbiology lab, where she conducted research as an undergraduate research scholar. Her research interests include studying the impacts of ocean acidification on the microbiome of corals reefs. Mahima loves to sing, cook, and spend time in the outdoors. She hopes to one day work at NGO that focuses on the intersections of climate policy, ocean conservation, and climate justice.
