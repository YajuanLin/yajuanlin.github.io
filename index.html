<p>I am a biological oceanographer and an assistant professor in Department of Life Sciences at <a href="https://www.tamucc.edu/">Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi</a>. Trained as a microbiologist, I am very interested in developing innovative biotech solutions to address climate change.</p>

<p>Current research interests <strong>Biological Oceanography, Microbiome, Biogeochemistry, and Climate Solutions.</strong></p>

<p>Teaching BIOL 4340 Genomics Proteomics and Bioinformatics, BIOL 2421 Microbiology, and MARB 6340 Marine Organisms and Processes.</p>

<p>I received my B.S. in Biology/Geology (double major) from Peking University and Ph.D. in Marine Science and Conservation from Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University. My doctoral research focused on the cyanobacterium <em>Prochlorococcus</em>, the smallest but most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the ocean. I established a method to measure the genotype specific growth rates using ribosomal RNA contents, and related the growth rates to different environmental variables in tropical and subtropical oceans.</p>

<p>I have been working intensively with the polar ocean systems. I study how microbial community, both autotrophs and heterotrophs, interact as consortia to drive biological carbon exports. I am currently building a FARACAS (cavity ring down spectroscopy) <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04977">(Cassar et al., 2018)</a> to measure N2 fixation continuously. My research is at the nexus of high-throughput molecular biology (omics) and high-resolution biogeochemistry. Combining these two directions provides me with unique tools to explore the mechanisms of microbial driven carbon and nitrogen cycles. More broadly, these insights contribute to biogeochemical modeling, food web dynamics, and ecosystem conservationâ€”advancing our ability to understand and protect our environments in a changing climate.</p>
