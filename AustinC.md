I am a Junior undergraduate environmental science student in TAMU-CCâ€™s Honors Program with a concentration in Marine and Coastal Resources. My research interests include studying ocean and coral reef conservation, climate change, as well as a wide variety of environmental issues while in my undergraduate. I enjoy going to the beach, hanging out with my friends, and listening to different kinds of music.
