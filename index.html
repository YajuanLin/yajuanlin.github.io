<p>I am a biological oceanographer and an assistant professor in Department of Life Sciences at <a href="https://www.tamucc.edu/">Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi</a>. I am interested in understanding the energy fluxes in marine ecosystems and the elemental fluxes in biogeochemical cycles. In particular, I study carbon exports in the sunlit surface ocean.</p>

<p>Current research interests <strong>Biological Oceanography, Microbiome, Biogeochemistry, and Climate Solutions.</strong></p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. in Marine Science and Conservation from Duke University. My PhD research focused on the cyanobacterium <em>Prochlorococcus</em>, the smallest but most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the ocean. I established a method to measure the genotype specific growth rates using ribosomal RNA contents, and related the growth rates to different environmental variables in tropical and subtropical oceans.</p>

<p>I have been working intensively with the polar ocean systems. I study how microbial communities (both autotrophs and heterotrophs) and their interactions drive biological carbon exports measured by the underway O2/Ar method. I am currently building a FARACAS <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04977">(Cassar et al., 2018)</a> to measure N2 fixation continuously. My research is at the nexus of high-throughput molecular biology (omics) and high-resolution biogeochemistry. Combining these two directions provides me with unique tools to explore the mechanisms of carbon exports. On a broader scale our findings benefit other fields such as biogeochemical modeling, food web dynamics, and ecosystem conservation, offering insights and protecting environments in the face of climate change.</p>
